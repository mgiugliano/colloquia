				<h2 class="major">Evaluation Methods</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.png" alt="" /></span>

<p>The "Colloquia in Bioengineering" course includes an oral presentation for evaluation. Each student must prepare and give a 30-minute PowerPoint presentation on a topic chosen from the themes covered by the guest speakers during the course. This method allows for the evaluation of the student's ability to apply acquired knowledge and understanding, exercise autonomous judgment, and demonstrate effective communication skills, in line with the expected learning objectives. The presentation will be followed by a dedicated question and answer session, aimed at deepening the student's understanding and critical thinking.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Timing</h3>
<p><b>Location:</b> The evaluation will take place at the end of the teaching period, during the official exam sessions.</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> Each student's presentation will have an approximate duration of 30 minutes, including the subsequent question and answer session.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Scoring Criteria for the Final Grade</h3>
<p>The final grade will be based on the following criteria and their respective weights:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Content and Depth of Knowledge (40%):</b> Evaluates the student's ability to thoroughly understand the chosen topic, demonstrate a solid command of technical concepts, and integrate insights from guest lectures and relevant literature.</li>
    <li><b>Application and Critical Analysis (30%):</b> Evaluates the student's ability to apply acquired knowledge, critically analyze the chosen topic, and, if applicable, propose original perspectives or solutions within the context of bioengineering.</li>
    <li><b>Presentation and Communication Skills (20%):</b> Evaluates the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of the oral presentation, including the logical structure of the content, visual aids, and the ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and concisely.</li>
    <li><b>Participation and Responsiveness During Q&A (10%):</b> Measures the student's ability to engage in discussion, answer questions accurately, and defend the arguments presented.</li>
</ul>
<p>A minimum score of 18/30 is required to pass the exam, indicating a reasonably sufficient preparation in terms of both content and expressive language.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Useful and Permitted Materials for the Exam</h3>
<p>Students are required to consult course materials, including slides from guest speakers' lectures, recommended readings, and external scientific literature (journal articles, conference proceedings, textbooks) relevant to the chosen presentation topic. The use of PowerPoint software for the presentation and any necessary multimedia tools (e.g., for embedding videos) is permitted and encouraged to enhance the clarity and impact of the presentation.</p>
